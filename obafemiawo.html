							<p><b>Early life:-</b> Obafemi was born on 06/03/1909,in ikenne,western region,british Nigeria(now known as ikenne,Ogun-state Nigeria) as the only son of Mr.David shopolu Awolowo(farmer & lawyer) and Mrs.Mary Efunyela Awolowo. He had 2 sisters and 1 maternalhalf-sister.Awolowo's father was born to ahigh chief and a member of the Iwarefa,the traditional Osugbo group that ruledIkenne. In 1896, Awolowo's father becameone of the first Ikenne natives to convert toChristianity. Awolowo's paternalgrandmother, Adefule Awolowo, whoAwolowo adored, was a devout worshipperof the Ifá. Adefule,Awolowo'sgrandmother, believed that Obafemi was areincarnation of her father (his great-grandfather). Awolowo's father's conversion to Christianity often went atodds with his family's beliefs. He often
challenged worshippers of the god of
smallpox,(Obaluaye).His father died
when on April 8, 1920 of smallpox when
Obafemi was about eleven years old.</p>
							<p><b>education profile:-</b>He attended various schools,includingBaptist Boys' High School (BBHS),Abeokuta; and then became a teacher inAbeokuta, after which he qualified as ashorthand typist.
Subsequently, he served
as a clerk at the Wesley College Ibadan,also as a correspondent for the NigerianTimes.
It was after this that heembarked on various business ventures tohelp raise funds to travel to the UK for further studies. Following his education at
Wesley College, Ibadan, in 1927, he
enrolled at the University of London as anExternal Student and graduated with thedegree of Bachelor of Commerce
(Hons.).He went to the UK in 1944 to
study law at the University of London and
was called to the Bar by the Honorable
Society of the Inner Temple on 19
November 1946.
In 1949 Awolowofounded the Nigerian Tribune, a privateNigerian newspaper, which he used tospread nationalist consciousness amongNigerians.</p>

  <p><b>politics:-</b>Awolowo was Nigeria's foremostfederalist.
In his Path to Nigerian
Freedom (1947) – the first systematic
federalist manifesto by a Nigerian
politician – he advocated federalism asthe only basis for equitable nationalintegration and, as head of the ActionGroup, he led demands for a federalconstitution, which was introduced in the1954 Lyttleton Constitution, followingprimarily the model proposed by the
Western Region delegation led by him.
He belong a political party named "action group" between year 1950-1963.
As premier, he proved to be and was
viewed as a man of vision and a dynamicadministrator.
Awolowo was also thecountry's leading social democratic politician.
He supported limited publicownership and limited central planning in
government.
He believed that the state
should channel Nigeria's resources intoeducation and state-led infrastructuraldevelopment.
Controversially, and at
considerable expense, he introduced freeprimary education for all and free healthcare for children in the Western Region,established the first television service inAfrica in 1959, and the Oduduwa Group, all
of which were financed from the highlylucrative cocoa industry which was themainstay of the regional economy.</p>
<p><b>Crisis in Western Nigeria:-</b>
From the eve of independence, he led theAction Group as the Leader of the
Opposition in the federal parliament,
leaving <a href="ladokeakintola.html">Samuel Ladoke Akintola</a> as the
Western Region Premier. Disagreements
between Awolowo and Akintola on how torun the Western region led the latter to analliance with the <a href="tafawabalewa.html">Tafawa Balewa</a>-led NPCfederal government.
 A constitutional crisisled to the declaration of a state ofemergency in the Western Region,eventually resulting in a widespreadbreakdown of law and order.
Excluded from national government,
Awolowo and his party faced an
increasingly precarious position. Akintola's
followers, angered at their exclusion frompower, formed the Nigerian NationalDemocratic Party (NNDP) under Akintola'sleadership. Having previously suspendedthe elected Western Regional Assembly,
the federal government then reconstitutedthe body after manoeuvres that broughtAkintola's NNDP into power without anelection.
Shortly afterwards Awolowo andseveral disciples were arrested, charged,
convicted (of treason),and jailed forconspiring with the Ghanaian authorities under Balewa to overthrow the federal
government.
After his release,he became a federal commisional of finance between the year 1967-1971.</p>
  <p><b>legacy:-</b>In 1992, the Obafemi Awolowo Foundation
was founded as an independent, non-
profit, non-partisan organisation
committed to furthering the symbiotic
interaction of public policy and relevantscholarship with a view to promoting theoverall development of the Nigeriannation. The Foundation was launched bythe President of Nigeria at that time,General Ibrahim Babangida, at the LibertyStadium, Ibadan. 
However, his most important bequests (styled Awoism) arehis exemplary integrity, his welfarism, his contributions to hastening the process ofdecolonisation and his consistent andreasoned advocacy of federalism-basedon ethno-linguistic self-determination anduniting politically strong states-as the best
basis for Nigerian unity. Awolowo died
peacefully at his Ikenne home, the
Efunyela Hall (so named after his mother),
on 9 May 1987, at the age of 78 and was
laid to rest in Ikenne, amid tributes across
political and ethno-religious divides.</p>
 <p><b>honour:-</b>He is featured in the 100 Naira banknote
since 1999.
