							<p><b>Early life:-</b>Akintola was born on 06/07/1910 in
Ogbomosho, Western
Region, Colonial(now known as Ogbomosho,Oyo-state,Nigeria) to the
family of Akintola Akinbola and Akanke,
his father was a trader and descended
from a family of traders.
At a young age,the family moved to Minna and he wasbriefly educated at a Church Missionary Society school in the city.
 In 1922, hereturned to Ogbomosho to live with hisgrandfather and subsequently attended a
Baptist day school before proceeding toBaptist College in 1925.
He taught at theBaptist Academy from 1930 to 1942 andthereafter worked briefly with the NigerianRailway Corporation.
 During this period, hebecame acquainted with Chief H.O. Davies,a lawyer and politician and joined theNigerian Youth Movement where heassisted Ikoli and supported the latter torepresent Lagos in the legislative council
over the candidacy of Oba Samuel
Akisanya, who was supported byAzikiwe.
He joined the staff of the Daily Service Newspaper and soon became the
editor in 1943 with the support of Chief
Akinola Maja, a shareholder, replacingErnest Ikoli as editor.
Akintola was alsofounder of Iroyin Yoruba, a newspaperwritten in the Yoruba language.
In 1945,he opposed the general strike led byAzikiwe's NCNC and Michael Imoudu,earning the distrust of politicians like Chief
Anthony Enahoro.
In 1946, he earned aBritish scholarship to study in the U.K. andcompleted legal studies by 1950.
Hestarted his legal career working as alawyer on land and civic matters. In 1952,
he formed a partnership with Chief Chris Ogunbanjo, Chief Bode Thomas and
Michael Odesanya.</p>
							<p><b>personal life:-</b>Akintola was married to Chief (Mrs)
Faderera Akintola and had five children,two of whom were later to becomeministers of state for finance in theNigerian Third Republic (Chief YomiAkintola and Chief (Dr.) Abimbola
Akintola).
Chief Yomi Akintola alsoserved as Nigeria's Ambassador toHungary and Samuel Akintola's daughter-in-law, Mrs. Dupe Akintola, was Nigeria's
High Commissioner in Jamaica.
His fourthchild, Chief Victor Ladipo Akintola,dedicated much of his life to ensuring thecontinued accurate accounting of SamuelAkintola's contributions to Nigeria'sposition on the world stage.
He publishedmany works including a biography thathighlighted his father's love of his countryand lifelong commitment to its progress
(Akintola: The Man and the Legend).
His youngest child, Tokunbo Akintola, wasthe first black boy at Eton College andfeatures prominently in the best sellingbook by the Nigerian author DilibeOnyeama, Nigger at Eton.</p>

  <p><b>political career:-</b>After he was trained as a lawyer in the
United Kingdom, Ladoke Akintola returned
to Nigeria in 1949 and teamed up with
other educated Nigerians from the
Western Region to form the Action Group(AG) under the leadership of <a href="obafemiawo.html">ChiefObafemi Awolowo</a>.
He initially was the
legal adviser of the group before
becoming the deputy leader in 1953
after the death of Bode Thomas.
Hedefeated Arthur Prest in the primary to succeed Bode Thomas.
As the deputyleader of the AG party, he did not serve inthe regional Western Region Government
headed by the premier Awolowo but was
the Action Group Parliamentary
Leader/Leader of Opposition in the Houseof Representatives of Nigeria.
 At thefederal level he served as Minister forHealth and later Minister forCommunications and Aviation.
Decisions over the direction of strategicalliances by the party, the adoption ofdemocratic socialism as the party'splatform and the battle for supremacy inthe party led to disagreement between Chiefs Akintola and Awolowo.
Akintoladisagreed with Awolowo's decision not tojoin the coalition government.
Akintolafelt the Yoruba people of the West werelosing their pre-eminent position inbusiness, university and administration inNigeria to the Igbo people of the Eastsimply because the Igbo-controlled NCNChad joined the government and the AG had
not.
He also opposed the party'sdecision to adopt democratic socialism asits ideology, preferring a more conservative stance.</p>
 <p><b>criticism:-</b>Akintola was accused by Chief Awolowofor trying to supplant him as Leader of theparty.
In May 1962 with the Western
House of Assembly set to remove Akintolaafter the party had earlier passed a vote ofno confidence in the premier in a partymeeting, crisis erupted on the floor of thehouse.
The AG party broke into twofactions leading to several crises in the Western Region House of Assembly that
led the central/federal government,
headed by the Prime Minister <a href="tafawabalewa.html">Sir Abubakar
Tafawa Balewa</a> to declare State of
Emergency rule in the region and Chief(Dr.) M.A Majekodunmi, the FederalMinister of Health was appointed as Administrator .
Eventually Akintola wasrestored to power (even though he had lost
the legal battle with the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council then
Nigeria's highest tribunal)as Premier in1963.
In the general election of 1965,
Akintola won his position as Premier, notas member of the Action Group party, butas the leader of a newly formed partycalled Nigerian National Democratic Party
(NNDP), which was in an alliance with theNorthern People's Congress (NPC) theparty that then controlled the federalgovernment.</p>

  <p><b>Death:-</b>Akintola was assassinated in Ibadan, thecapital of Western Region, on the day of
Nigeria's first military coup of 15 January1966â€”which terminated the FirstRepublic.
Also known as the "YoungMajors Coup" or the "coup of the Januaryboys", the coup resulted in theassassination of many leading politicians,mostly members of the Northern People's congress.</p>
  <p><b>impact:-</b>Akintola was a dignified orator. 
In 1962he was responsible for completing thefounding of the University of Ife (a brainchild of Awolowo, which wasrenamed in his honour). He was alsoinvolved in the development of PremierHotel and other monuments.
A number of institutions, including LadokeAkintola University of Technology,Ogbomosho, were established in both theOloye's home town and other Nigeriancities as a means of remembering him posthumously.</p>
